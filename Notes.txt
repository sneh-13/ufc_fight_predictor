Notes:

Data -> Model -> Predictions

Data:
- Split Dataset into x & u
    - dataset x contains everything used to make the predictions
        - ex. information about houses
    - dataset y contains the predition
        - ex. house prices

Model:
- 1. Create the Model
- 2. Train the Model (.fit(x,y))

Using the fighter fight stats to traina model?:
1. The Trap: Data Leakage (Don't do this for Prediction)
If your goal is to predict who will win a fight before it happens, you cannot 
include the stats from that specific fight.

If you tell your model: "One fighter landed 50 ground strikes in this fight," 
the model will immediately realize that person won. It's essentially "cheating" 
by giving the model the answers. This is called Data Leakage. Your model would 
look 100% accurate in testing, but it would be completely useless for predicting 
next week's UFC event because you wouldn't have those numbers yet.

2. The Solution: Historical Averages (Do this for better results!)
While you can't use the strikes from the current fight, you should absolutely 
use the averages from previous fights.

If you calculate a fighter's Ground Strike Average over their last 3 fights, 
that is a massive improvement. It tells the model the fighter's style:

High Clinch Strikes: Tells the model this fighter is a "grinder" or a "dirty boxer."
High Ground Strikes: Tells the model this fighter is a "ground-and-pound" specialist.

3. Why it would give better results
The features you have now (wins, height, reach) are "static" stats. Adding style-based stats
 (clinch, ground, submission attempts) helps the model understand match-ups:

Example: A fighter with high "Strikes Absorbed" (bad defense) going up against someone
 with high "Ground Strikes" (strong top control). The model can now "see" that if the 
 fight hits the ground, it's a disaster for the first fighter.
